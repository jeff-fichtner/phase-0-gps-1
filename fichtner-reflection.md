#Reflection

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

>I was struggling to grasp the workflow between two pairing partners.  I didn't understand how to set up a session and what repo to work out of.  I also didn't understand the use for fetch/merge vs pulling, but did understand the concept.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

>Both of those concepts and uses.  Both working out of one repo and fetching, reviewing and THEN merging rather than just pulling, makes sense.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

>I asked about the difference of pulling and fetching/merging, and I worked through merge conflicts with my pair after the guide signed off.

What still confuses you about Git?

>I'm sure there are general workflow aspects I am not familiar with, but won't be familiar with until I start using them.  For starting projects/solo projects, I seem to understand Git just fine.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

>I had a blast!  Both Eileen and I stayed up for odd hours to pair and I was tired at the end, but I loved working with both her and Sharmila, and Sharmila was very helpful.  Having the GPS before my individual pairing sessions would have been helpful for my pairing sessions but having my pairing sessions also allowed me to ask questions I needed to ask during my GPS.
