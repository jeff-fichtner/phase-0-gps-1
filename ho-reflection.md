#Release 7: Reflect

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with the expectations for pairing and where we would be keeping track of our work with a pair (creating a new repository, switching driver/navigator while tracking changes, etc.)

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The process of collaborating with a pair over Github was greatly clarified.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

It was helpful to have a guide and my pair on hand to answer questions related to wording git commands.  I need much more practice with that.  And command line in general.  They were a great resource.

* What still confuses you about Git?

I think I understand it in general, just getting used to the flow.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I thought it went ok.  I think I got along with my pair.  I didn't realize that the guide wasn't going to be present for the whole session, so I probably would have tried to move faster during the previous releases, and save my simple questions more for my pair.
